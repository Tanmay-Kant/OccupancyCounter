# OccupancyCounter

## Week 1-2 (2/5 AND 2/13)

### IDEATION -> PROPOSAL -> RESEARCH

### Objective of the Week:
The goal these weeks was to identify a significant problem in the field of building management systems that our project could address, focusing on enhancing efficiency and sustainability.

### Tasks Accomplished:
#### TANMAY
Conducted a comprehensive review of common issues faced in building management, especially in HVAC systems.
Identified the inefficiencies in energy consumption as a critical area where improvements could be significantly impactful.
Collaborated with project partners to define the scope and objectives of our project, aiming to develop a solution that could integrate easily into existing systems.

#### ASHWIN
After having a review of common issues faced in building management with my group, we found that there were inefficiencies in energy consumption when dealing with HVAC systems. We found that this could be an area that we could try to improve and make more efficient, as a lot of energy is being wasted. I worked with my group in order to define the scope and objectives of this project to find a solution that could coexist with the HVAC systems.

#### ARYAN
Explored options such as energy optimization through Smart HVAC systems, and lighting control. Considered using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to monitor weather forecasts, indoor air quality, etc to optimize HVAC operations. Also looked at the possibility of building a smart lighting system that adjusts artificial light based on natural light, and incorporate the concept of daylight harvesting. 

### Goals for the Following Week:
Meet with project partners to finalize the project concept and begin outlining the initial approach for the occupancy counter.
Start gathering resources and conducting preliminary research on suitable technologies that can be utilized for the project.

## Week 3 (2/19)

### Objective of the Week:
The primary goal for this week was to solidify our project idea with my team members Aryan and Ashwin. We aimed to develop a concept that could address inefficiencies in HVAC systems within buildings, particularly focusing on adapting HVAC performance based on actual room occupancy.

### Tasks Accomplished:

#### TANMAY
Collaborated with Aryan and Ashwin to finalize our project concept. We decided to design an occupancy counter that uses Time of Flight sensors to determine the number of people in a room. This device would help manage HVAC systems more efficiently by providing live data on room occupancy.
Discussed and documented the problem statement, which emphasizes the need for energy efficiency in large building environments where HVAC systems often waste energy by heating or cooling unoccupied or partially occupied spaces.
Outlined the solution where our project would utilize Time of Flight Sensor Modules for detecting room occupants. We planned to either use one module split between two zones or two modules to determine entry and exit, with a WiFi-enabled Arduino Board processing the data.
Prepared an initial sketch of our project’s technical approach, including the hardware setup and the software logic that would drive the data processing and user interface.

#### ASHWIN
We looked into different parts in order to design an occupancy counter, and decided that implementing a Time of Flight sensor to determine the number of people in a room seems like the best course of action. We believe this part would help manage HVAC systems effectively because the sensor is able to find live data on room occupancy. My group and I outlined the solution for our project to utilize Time of Flight Sensor Modules to detecting room occupants. From our discussions and research, we figured the best way is to either use one module split between two zones or two separate modules in order to determine entry and exit of a person. We also think the best way to use these sensors is with a WiFi-enabled Arduino Board to help with data processing.

#### ARYAN
Worked with my teammates to finalize our project idea. After sifting through different ideas, evaluating pros and cons, and the rigor and feasibility of the projects, we came to the final conclusion of creating a room “occupancy counter”. The reason for this project was consistent with our original vision of working on efficiency in building management systems. Our innovation aims to optimize HVAC systems by providing real-time occupancy data. By using Time of Flight sensors, we knew that we could come up with a simple, yet effective solution to deal with the widespread problem of loss of energy due to heating or cooling unoccupied spaces. Our early stage ideas included using either one module for two zones or two modules to track entry and exit, with a WiFi-enabled Arduino Board processing the collected data. 

### Goals for the Following Week:
Begin the technical design, focusing on the selection of sensors and the development of the initial wiring and circuit diagrams.
Start drafting the software architecture, including how data from the sensors will be processed and displayed on a web interface.

#### ASHWIN
The room count has properly been set up in order to account for people entering and exiting a zone. We started working on edge cases in order to determine if they should count as a person who entered or exited a room. The main edge case we worked on was when. Person would enter the first 2 zones, and then decide to turn around and not fully enter/exit the room. We broke the code down into 4 zones in order to account for this situation. In addition, I also was able to successfully transfer the room count to a digital display using WiFi setup. Setting a personal hotspot worked as well, satisfying our universal compatibility requirement.

#### ARYAN
With our hardware largely finalized, safe, and secure, we continued work on the software aspect. I had thought of some edge cases that we needed to address, and we proceeded with the 4-zone idea. With the challenge of extra authorization needed to use university WiFi, we decided to utilize a hotspot for our initial testing, to make it universally accessible by anyone with a hotspot connection.
